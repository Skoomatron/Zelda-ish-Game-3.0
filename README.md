<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Making games always seemed intimidating but after getting some intense experience with React and managing to make a fairly <a href="https://github.com/Skoomatron/MVP
">rudimentary game</a> in that environment I decided to upskill to Unity/C#.  A pseudo Zelda game seemed like a great entry point because it is a time honored classic, an expandable platform to build off of, and not overly complicated in my eyes fundamtenally.  With this project I am diving deep on what the code is doing and why that works via a Notion journal.  The end goal here is to take the training wheels off and that day seems to feel like it's closing in.
